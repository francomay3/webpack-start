# Webpack starting template

This is just a starting point for any vanillaJS project I work on.

### Get started

1. Create a new repo from the GitHub dashboard and select *import* from the options. Paste `https://github.com/francomay3/nBodySimulator.git` in the *svn* field and finish the repo creation.
2. Open a terminal in the new directory and run `npm i && npm run build`
3. Done! you can now open index.html in the public folder and read the text **Hello World**

You will find the main source file in `src/index.js`
If you just want to compile your changes, run `npm run build`
If you want to run a local server with **hot** reload, then run `npm run start` ;)

Enjoy your coding!
